Assignment # 1

Q1) Render these into component:
const name = "Hello World";
const obj = {name: "Hello World Object"}
const data = ['We', 'are', 'United'] //Show these in seperate tags
const list = [{name: "Hello World 1"}, {name: "Hello World 2"}, {name: "Hello World 3"}] //Show these in seperate tags
const complex = [{company: 'XYZ', jobs: ['Javascript,' 'React']}, {company: 'ABC', jobs: ['AngularJs' 'Ionic']}]

Q2) Briefly explain with an example what's the difference between 
import Something from 'package' VS import {Something} from 'package'

Q3) Just copy and paste the data from these links and store them into a variable:
const posts = https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts //copy the array from this link
const users = https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users //copy the array from this link
//DON'T USE FETCH FOR NOW

Using above API's, you've to render all the users with their names, emails and their posts.
Use `id` as a key with each data rendering.

Assignment # 2

1) Using states, render a text "Hello World", on clicking it, it should toggle to "Hello Pakistan", and vice versa! 
2) Write the difference between onClick={this.myFunc}, onClick={() => this.myFunc()} & onClick={this.myFunc.bind(this}} and when to use which one

Assignment # 3

Develop a login screen, it should allow only Admin to login, you can set (admin@domain.com/admin) as email/password, otherwise it should alert error of "Wrong Credentials". 
Use Sweet Alert Library for the alerts (https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/).
After login, show a list of employees in a table and an add button (Floating Action Button on bottom right: HINT: Search 'floating action button') to add employee details.
Develop an employees info form with the following details:
1) First Name, 2) Last Name, 3) Email, 4) Salary, 5) Job Start Date (Should be Javascript Date)

More Features:
Admin can Edit (Each Field), and Delete the Employees as well!
Admin can logout and redirect to login screen.

MORE HINTS:
According to the lectures uptil now! 
Your App.js render function must be like atleast:

render(){
const { user, addForm } = this.state;

return(
{/* when the user state is empty, show login */}
{!user && this.renderLogin()}
{/* when the user is logged in and Add button isn't clicked, show the List of Employees */}
{user && !addForm && this.showTable()}
{/* when the user is logged in and Add button is clicked, show the Add Form */}
{user && addForm && this.addEmployeeForm()}
)
}

If you can break this render functions into components, that will be awesome! +20 Points for that!
No Database required for now! Just hardcoded values!
